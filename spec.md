# ewasm specification

## Introduction

This document aims to specify an ewasm VM in a way useful to contract writers and VM implementers.
To this end, multiple things are specified:

-   The extra state that a VM needs to have around to successfully respond to calls into the EEI.
-   The EEI (Ethereum Environment Interface), currently specified loosley [here](eth_interface.md).

## Execution State

## Initialisation of a contract

## Execution of the contract entry point

## Host functions available to the contract
